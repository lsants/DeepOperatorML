# DeepOperatorML

## Description

This project aims to develop a framework for solving problems (e.g., PDEs) using an Operator Learning approach. The framework currently provides interfaces for data processing, a modular DeepONet architecture and a wide variety of optimization schemes. The user can define a new custom problem using the interface and solve it using one of the implemented models.

## Project Overview

The project's goal is to provide a data-driven solver aggregating **state of the art** machine learning algorithms. The approach implemented was the employment of Operator learning schemes with for multi-output operators. Currently, vanilla DeepONets [Lu, et al., (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03193), POD-DeepONets [Lu, et al., (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05512) and Two-step DeepONet [Lee & Shin, (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01020) have been implemented. The model is developed in Python using PyTorch. Support for other tensor backend libraries (e.g., JAX, TensorFlow 2.x) are to be implemented in the future.

## Implemented Problems

The following problems have been implemented so far:

- Kelvin's problem (static response of an isotropic elastic 3D space to a point load).
- Green's functions for transversely isotropic elastic half space (Rajapakse & Wang, 1993).
- Lorentz system [Lorentz, 1963](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020%3C0130:DNF%3E2.0.CO;2), describing a nonlinear, chaotic dynamical system resulting from fluid flow due to convective heat transfer.

## Usage

### Data generation

The data for training the DeepOnet can be generated by defining the boundary value problem's parameters in the  `/configs/problems/[problem-name]/datagen.yaml` file and running the `gen_data.py` script with the `--problem` flag with the desired problem. Next, define the properties of the operator learning architecture's dataset through the  `/configs/problems/[problem-name]/config_preprocessing.yaml` file and generate the processed dataset using the `preprocessed_data.py --problem [problem-name]` script.

### Model definition

The chosen neural operator is configured with the `/configs/training/[config-model-train].yaml`.

### Training and inference

The chosen model with its corresponding chosen dataset are trained with the command: `main.py --problem [problem-name]`. The same `main.py` script is used to test the model with the `--test` argument.
