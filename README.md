# High Performance Numeric Integration

### Description

Welcome to the repository for the High Performance Numeric Integration project, a Scientific Initiation Project, financed by the São Paulo Research Foundation and affiliated to Unicamp's Mechanical Engineering Faculty's Laboratory of Soil-Structure Interaction. This initiative focuses on advancing the field of large-scale mathematical modeling, specifically in the context of significant projects like the Sirius Particle Accelerator in Brazil.

### Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop state of the art high-performance mathematical models tailored for large-scale applications. Specifically, we are dedicated to enhancing the efficiency of numeric integral computations through the application of neural networks.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Numeric Integration:** Our project aims to redefine numeric integration methods, with a focus on speed and scalability.
  
- **Python Implementation:** All models are implemented in Python, leveraging the powerful capabilities of PyTorch's API.
